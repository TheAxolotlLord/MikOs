# MikOs
A Hatsune Miku Operating System

It's best to go in blind!

I'm adding lore to this OS, and it's fun to work on!
If you want to just see some of it, you can use the username "guest". There is no password for that account.
To find out other Users and Passes, either peek in the code (which is no fun) or guess!
